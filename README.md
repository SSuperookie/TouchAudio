# TouchAudio
 This project aims to design and develop a wearable environmental sound perception
 system for the deaf based on sound recognition and electro-tactile feedback, offering an
 intelligent auditory assistive solution. Through the application of sound classification
 technology, environmental sounds can be converted into commands and conveyed to the deaf
 through electro-tactile encoding, enabling them to perceive and understand different
 environmental sounds.
